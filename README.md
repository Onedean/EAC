## Todo List:

- [ ] We plan to release a spatio-temporal foundation model (much more advanced than what we have now) in the coming months, so stay tuned! ü§´


## Updates/News:

üö© **News** (Apr. 2025): We upload all processed complete datasets to the [cloud disk](https://hkustgz-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wchen110_connect_hkust-gz_edu_cn/EuiKtt95qnpNgOngXAV_MmABWYyEBh74ooM94kdycwg4Sw?e=ZRCC1n), and you can download them directly to avoid the difficulty of reproducing the processing problems! üòé

üö© **News** (Feb. 2025): EAC's code, data, weights, and training logs are fully open source! Try to improve on this! üòä

üö© **News** (Jan. 2025): EAC has been accpeted by ICLR 2025! ‚úÖ



## üìñ Introduction

Spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly-arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. 
To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, EAC, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters.

## üìö Training Data

[Important]: Now, the processed dataset can be directly accessed from the [cloud disk](https://hkustgz-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wchen110_connect_hkust-gz_edu_cn/EuiKtt95qnpNgOngXAV_MmABWYyEBh74ooM94kdycwg4Sw?e=ZRCC1n)!

Our datasets are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OiMLuFBdc56CLekileRjH0xyhDWuoC6C?usp=drive_link).

Please download all processed datasets and place them in the [data folder](./data).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Please install the core dependencies, including:

```shell
python = 3.8.5
pytorch = 1.7.1
torch-geometric = 1.6.3
```

2. Or you can directly create and import a ready-made environment:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate stg
```

### Usages

1. You can run a specific method on a specific dataset separately, for example, run the EAC method on the PEMS-Stream dataset:

```python
python main.py --conf conf/PEMS/eac.json --gpuid 0 --seed 43
```

2. Or you can run the script to batch execute all baseline methods on a specified dataset, for example, run all baseline methods on the PEMS-Stream dataset:

```shell
sh scripts/pems_run.sh
```

## üí¥ Code repository summary

###  Summary of all model weights, logs, and configuration. 

+ **Config File**: Please refer to the [conf file](./conf) for the configuration details of different methods in different datasets. Note that all parameters follow almost the same settings.

+ **Log File**: Please refer to the [log file](./log) for the log details of different methods in different datasets. Note that the logs of different periods of a method in a data set are summarized in one file.

+ **Weight File**: Please refer to the [log file](./log) for the weight details of different methods in different datasets. Note that due to the limitation of uploaded files and size, we currently only upload one random seed weight for each experiment of each method.

### Summary of all results and observation. 

+ **Empirical Observation**: The analysis code for the observations in Figures 3 and 4 of the paper is in [empirical_observation.ipynb](empirical_observation.ipynb) file.

+ **Result Analysis**: The analysis code for the observations in Tables 1, 3 and Figures 5, 6, 7 of the paper is in [result_statistical.ipynb](empirical_observation.ipynb) file.
