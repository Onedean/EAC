##  Summary of all model weights, logs, and configuration. 

+ **Config File**: Please refer to the [conf file](./conf) for the configuration details of different methods in different datasets. Note that all parameters follow almost the same settings.

+ **Log File**: Please refer to the [log file](./log) for the log details of different methods in different datasets. Note that the logs of different periods of a method in a data set are summarized in one file.

+ **Weight File**: Please refer to the [log file](./log) for the weight details of different methods in different datasets. Note that due to the limitation of uploaded files and size, we currently only upload one random seed weight for each experiment of each method.

## Summary of all results and observation. 

+ **Empirical Observation**: The analysis code for the observations in Figures 3 and 4 of the paper is in [empirical_observation.ipynb](empirical_observation.ipynb) file.

+ **Result Analysis**: The analysis code for the observations in Tables 1, 3 and Figures 5, 6, 7 of the paper is in [result_statistical.ipynb](empirical_observation.ipynb) file.

## Summary of codes.

+ Our official code will be released after notification.
